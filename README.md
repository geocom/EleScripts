#About EleScripts
This repo is provided as a static building block for your application. Any application that needs to run another javascript library where the code does not include your ID will need to upload the code here so that other applications can use the same code base for there application without conflicts.

Pull Request Processing Time

* New Library - ASAP provided it does not conflict with other libraries
* Update To Library
	* No depreciation or Major Changes or New Feature - 1 Week
	* Depreciation or Major Change - 1 Month(For all parties to respond)
	* Security Fix affecting current version - 1-2 Days(depending or severity)

###Why 

This repo exists because we want to make sure that there is no unintended consequences for developers using the same libraries. However we want to make sure that new features are added for those who want it. We feel this approach is the correct one as it removes any issues of the same library being duplicated and version issues from appearing.

**This repo is by design conservative and is not designed to be bleeding edge. **

###Do I Have Too?
* If your application is going to be public. Yes you have to use this list.
* If your application is going to remain private there is no requirement to use this list and you can use any library you like. However you will need to support this your self and if you use another developers application understand things may break. You may use this list and you will be informed of changes being made in the same way that other developers are. So if you can use these libraries.

#Addition Requirements.
To add a libary to the repo you must supply the libary in the format in the example folder.
You must include the following

* JS files.
* Licence file(md preferred).
* info.json.

#Licensing.
Applications included in this list **Must Be Open Source** and allow commercial use.
We will look at all licences before adding the Libary to this repo. If in doubt check with the creator of the libary first. If the licence changes to a licence that makes it closed source or no longer allows for commecal use, the current version will be retained unless we are required to pull the code.

#jQuery
jQuery and jQuery-UI are not included in this repo as it is required by default on Eleboards
